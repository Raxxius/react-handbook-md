    npm create vite@latest


## JavaScript and React

Where possible create projects using JavaScript and React. Do not use SWC (Speedy Web Compiler) or TypeScript


## Code Linting

Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as the linter


## Code Formatting with Prettier 

Uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format code. Run Prettier prior to commits to ensure code is consistantly formatted.


## Unit Testing with Jest

If using Unit Testing, use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to run these Test.


## General Dependency Guidelines

Try to limit the number of dependency pacakges to a minimum. Only use a package if it adds a feature that really saves substantial coding time.

All dependencies installed should be added to a dependency.md
